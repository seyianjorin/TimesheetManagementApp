Timesheet Management App 
.

I was not able to make the migrations for both my apps. I got an error " ImportError: cannot import name 'Doctor' from partially initialized module 'userapp.models' (most likely due to a circular import) (/Users/oluwaseyiayo-anjorin/Desktop/TimesheetApp/userapp/models.py) " - Oluwaseyi 05/23/2022
